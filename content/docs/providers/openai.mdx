# Setting up OpenAI with LocalProxy

This guide walks you through creating an OpenAI API key and configuring it in LocalProxy to intercept and manage AI API requests.

## Prerequisites

- LocalProxy installed and running
- An OpenAI account (create one at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com))

## Step 1: Create an OpenAI API Key

1. **Log in to OpenAI Platform**

   - Navigate to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Sign in with your OpenAI account

2. **Create a New API Key**

   - Click the **"Create new secret key"** button
   - Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "LocalProxy Integration")
   - Select permissions if prompted (typically "All")

**Important**: Copy the API key immediately - you won't be able to see it again

## Step 2: Configure OpenAI in LocalProxy

1. **Open LocalProxy Settings**

   - Launch LocalProxy if not already running
   - Click on **Settings** in the sidebar

2. **Navigate to AI Providers**

   - In the Settings page, find and click on **AI Providers**
   - This section manages all AI service configurations

3. **Add OpenAI Provider**

   - Click the **Add** button
   - From the provider list, select **OpenAI**

4. **Enter Your API Key**

   - Paste the API key you copied from OpenAI
   - Give it a friendly name (optional)
   - Configure any additional settings:
     - **Base URL**: Leave default unless using a proxy
     - **Model preferences**: Select default models if needed

5. **Save Configuration**
   - Click **Save** to store your OpenAI configuration
   - You should see OpenAI listed in your AI Providers
